# Eclipse Zenoh
The Eclipse Zenoh: Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query and Compute.

Zenoh (pronounce _/zeno/_) unifies data in motion, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

Check the website [zenoh.io](http://zenoh.io) and the [roadmap](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap) for more detailed information.

# C++ API

The Zenoh C++ API is a C++ bindings for [zenoh-c] and [zenoh-pico] libraries. The library is headers only,
but building [zenoh-c] requires [Rust](rust-lang) installed. Please check [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to learn how to install it.


C++ bindings are still so the Zenoh team will highly appreciate any help in testing them on various platforms, system architecture, etc. and to report any issue you might encounter. This will help in greatly improving its maturity and robustness.

-------------------------------
## How to build and install it

> :warning: **WARNING** :warning: : Zenoh and its ecosystem are under active development. When you build from git, make sure you also build from git any other Zenoh repository you plan to use (e.g. binding, plugin, backend, etc.). It may happen that some changes in git are not compatible with the most recent packaged Zenoh release (e.g. deb, docker, pip). We put particular effort in mantaining compatibility between the various git repositories in the Zenoh project.

To install [zenoh-cpp] do the following steps:

1. Clone the sources

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-cpp.git
   ```

2. Do install.
   Neither [zenoh-c] nor [zenoh-pico] are required for the installation, but both are neccessary for building tests and examples. So, instead of the main project, it's faster to do install from "install" subproject.

   Use option `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` for specifying installation location. Without this parameter installation is performed to default system location `/usr/local` which requires root privileges.

    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ../zenoh-cpp/install -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local
    cmake --install .
    ```

## Building and running tests

The [zenoh-cpp] is header-only C++ library that wraps [zenoh-c] and [zenoh-pico] libraries. To make tests and examples it tries to find `zenoh-c` and `zenoh-pico` libraries in the following places:

1. Directories `zenoh-c` and `zenoh-pico` located on the same level as `zenoh-cpp` itself. **WARNING**: If you see building errors, make sure that you don't have obsolete `zenoh-c` or `zenoh-pico` directories nearby

2. Libraries `zenoh-c` and `zenoh-pico` installed to system. **WARNING**: If you see building errors, make sure that no old version of libraries installed to `/usr/local/lib/cmake`

3. Download [zenoh-c] and [zenoh-pico] from GitHub

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ../zenoh-cpp
cmake --build . --target tests
ctest
```

Notice that the output of `cmake ../zenoh-cpp` shows where the dependencies were found

## Building the Examples

Examples are splitted into two subdirectories. Subdirectory `universal` contains [zenoh-cpp] examples buildable with both [zenoh-c] and [zenoh-pico] backends. The `zenohc` subdirectory contains examples with zenoh-c specific functionality.

The examples can be built in two ways. One is to select `examples` as a build target of the main project:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ../zenoh-cpp
cmake --build . --target examples
```

Examples are placed into `build/examples/zenohc` and `build/examples/zenohpico` directories.

Second way is to build `examples` as a root project, which includes [zenoh-cpp] as subproject

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ../zenoh-cpp/examples
cmake --build .
```

Examples are placed into `build/zenohc` and `build/zenohpico` directories.

## Running the examples

Change current directory to the variant you want (`examples/zenohc` or `examples/zenohpico` in the build directory)

See example sources for command line arguments (key expression, value, router address).

`zenohc` examples can work standalone, but for `zenohpico` examples the working zenoh router is required. So to run `zenohpico` examples download [zenoh] project and run the router ([Rust](rust-lang) should be installed):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh
cd zenoh
cargo run
```

### Basic Pub/Sub Example

```bash
./z_sub
```

```bash
./z_pub
```

The `z_pub` should receive message sent by `z_sub`

### Queryable and Query Example
```bash
./z_queryable
```

```bash
./z_get
```

The `z_get` should receive the data from `z_queryable`

### Throughput Examples
```bash
./z_sub_thr_cpp
```

```bash
./z_pub_thr_cpp 1024
```

After 30-40 seconds delay the `z_sub_thr` will start to show the throughput measure results

## Library usage

Below are the steps to include [zenoh-cpp] into CMake project. See also [examples/simple](examples/simple) directory for short examples of CMakeLists.txt.

- include [zenoh-c] or [zenoh-pico] into your CMake project.
  This is important as the library targets you need (`zenohcxx::zenohpico`, `zenohcxx::zenohc::lib` and `zenohcxx::zenohc::static)`
  are defined only if their backend library
  targets (`zenohpico`, `zenohc::lib` and `zenohc::static` are defined)

- include [zenoh-cpp] itself. This can be done with [add_subdirectory], [find_package] or [FetchContent] CMake commands.
  ```
  add_subdirectory(../zenoh-cpp)
  ```
  ```
  find_package(zenohcxx)
  ```
  ```
  FetchContent_Declare(zenohcxx GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-cpp GIT_TAG main)
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(zenohcxx)
  ```
- add dependency on zenoh-cpp to your project:
   ```
   target_link_libraries(yourproject PUBLIC zenohcxx::zenohpico)
   ```
   ```
   target_link_libraries(yourproject PUBLIC zenohcxx::zenohc::lib)
   ```
   ```
   target_link_libraries(yourproject PUBLIC zenohcxx::zenohc::static)
   ```

- include the [zenoh.hxx] header and use namespace `zenoh`. Depending on preprocessor setting in library target the correct namespace (`zenohpico` or `zenohc`) is aliased to `zenoh` namespace. This allows to write code compatible with both libraries without changes.
    ```C++
    #include "zenoh.hxx"
    using namespace zenoh;
    ```
    or use headers [zenohc.hxx] or [zenohpico.hxx] directly
    ```C++
    #include "zenohc.hxx"
    using namespace zenohc;
    ```
    ```C++
    #include "zenohpico.hxx"
    using namespace zenohpico;
    ```

## Library API

### Documentation

The library API is not documented yet, but the [api.hxx] file contains commented class definitions and can be used for reference.

### Conventions

There are three main kinds of wrapper classes / structures provided by [zenoh-cpp]. They are:

#### Structs derived from `Copyable` template:

```C++
struct PutOptions : public Copyable<::z_put_options_t> {
    ...
}
```

These structures can be freely passed by value. They exacly matches corresponging C-library structures (`z_put_options_t` in this case) and adds some necessary constructors and methods. For example `PutOptions` default constructor calls the zenohc/zenohpico function `z_put_options_default()`.

There are some copyable structures with `View` postfix:

```C++
struct BytesView : public Copyable<::z_bytes_t> {
...
}
```

Such structures contains pointers to some external data. So they should be cared with caution, as they becoming invalid when their data source is destroyed. The same carefulness is required when handling `std::string_view` from standard library for examlple.

#### Classes derived from `Owned` template

```C++
class Config : public Owned<::z_owned_config_t> {
...
}
```

Classes which protects corresponding so-called `owned` structures from copying, allowing move semantic only. Corresponding utility functions like `z_check`, `z_null`, `z_drop` are integrated into the `Owned` base template.

#### Closures

It's classes representing [zenoh-c] and [zenoh-pico] callback structures:
```C++
typedef ClosureMoveParam<::z_owned_closure_reply_t, ::z_owned_reply_t, Reply> ClosureReply;
typedef ClosureConstPtrParam<::z_owned_closure_query_t, ::z_query_t, Query> ClosureQuery;
```

They allows to wrap C++ invocable objects (fuctions, lambdas, classes with operator() overloaded) and pass them as callbacks to zenoh.

The `ClosureConstPtrParam` types accepts objects, invocable with `const Foo*` parameter. For example
```C++
session.declare_subscriber("foo/bar", [](const Sample *sample) { ... });
```
or
```C++
void on_query(const Query* query) { ... };
...
auto queryable = std::get<Queryable>(session.declare_queryable("foo/bar", on_query);
```

The `ClosureMoveParam` types accepts types, invocable with `Foo`, `Foo&` or `Foo&&`. Callback may take ownership of the reference parameter passed
or do nothing and leave to caller to drop it.
```C++
session.get("foo/bar", "", [](Reply reply) { ... });
session.get("foo/bar", "", [](Reply& reply) { ... });
session.get("foo/bar", "", [](Reply&& reply) { ... });
```

The `nullptr` or invalid value (`value.check() == false`) are passed to callback before the callback is dropped.
This may be changed in nearest future (see below).

### Known API issues and restrictions:

- Objects created by `Session` keeps reference to the stack instance of `Session` object. This means that C++ move semantics
doesn't supported correctly. See the code below (which is copied with a few changes from [here](examples/simple/universal/z_simple.cxx)).
**This is planned to be fixed in next release, on [zenoh-c] or [zenoh] level**
   ```C++
   Config config;
   Session s = std::get<Session>(open(std::move(config)));
   Session s1 = std::move(s); // That's ok
   Publisher p = std::get<Publisher>(s1.declare_publisher("demo/example/simple"));
   Session s_moved = std::move(s1); // DON'T DO THAT, `p` holds `&s1` reference when zenoh-c is used
   p.put("Value"); // CRASH!!!
   ```

- There is a special meaning for `null` parameter of closures: drop notification. So the programmer is responsible to test parameter for
validity on each call.  It doesn't follow the logic of original [zenoh] API and modern C++ practice, discouraging raw pointer usage.
So **in the next release the `const T*` closure prototype supposedly will be changed to `const T&`**.
```C++
session.declare_subscriber("foo/bar", [](const Sample *sample) {
   if (sample) {
      ... // process it
   } else {
      ... // cleanup
   }
});
```
