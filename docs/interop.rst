Interoperability with zenoh-c / zenoh-pico
==========================================
This is the list of the functions that can be use for interoperability between zenoh-c/zenoh-pico and
zenoh-cpp. These functions essentially perform conversion of c-structs into c++ classes and back. They should be used with
care, and it is up to the user to ensure that all necessary invariants uphold.
